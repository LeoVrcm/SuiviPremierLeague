                    The Premier League, often referred to as the English Premier League or the EPL, is the top level of the English football league system contested by 20 clubs.
                    Seasons run from August to May with each team playing 38 matches (playing all 19 other teams both home and away). Most games are played on Saturday and Sunday afternoons.
                    <br>
                    The competition was founded as the FA Premier League on 20 February 1992 following the decision of clubs in the Football League First Division to break away from the Football League, 
                    founded in 1888, and take advantage of a lucrative television rights sale to Sky.
                    <br> 
                    The Premier League is the most-watched sports league in the world, broadcast in 212 territories to 643 million homes and a potential TV audience of 4.7 billion people.
                    Fifty clubs have competed since the inception of the Premier League in 1992: forty-eight English and two Welsh clubs. 
                    Seven of them have won the title: Manchester United (13), Chelsea (5), Manchester City (5), Arsenal (3), Blackburn Rovers (1), Leicester City (1) and Liverpool (1).
                    <br>
                    The Premier League ranks first in the UEFA coefficients of leagues based on performances in European competitions over the past five seasons as of 2021.
                    The English top-flight has produced the second-highest number of UEFA Champions League/European Cup titles, with five English clubs having won fourteen European trophies in total.
